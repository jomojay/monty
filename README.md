# 0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO

## monty
The goal of this project is to create a custom interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files. This is achieved by implementing Stack and Queues(using doubly linked list) as datastructures that the interpreter can switch in between as the need arises during different operations.

## opcode operations

### push
pushes element into stack

### pop
deletes the topmost element from the stack

### pint
prints the topmost element grom the stack

### pall
print all the elements in the stack starting from top
