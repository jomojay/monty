# 0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO

## monty
The goal of this project is to create a custom interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files. This is achieved by implementing Stack and Queues(using doubly linked list) as datastructures that the interpreter can switch in between as the need arises during different operations.

## opcode operations

### push
pushes element into stack

### pop
deletes the topmost element from the stack

### pint
prints the topmost element grom the stack

### pall
print all the elements in the stack starting from top

### rotr
rotates stack to the bottom

### rotl
rotates stack to the left

### pstr
prints ascii value of the stacks elements starting from top

### pchar
prints ascii value of the element at the to of the stack

### mul
multiplies the top fist two topmost elements in the stack

### sub
subtracts the top element of the stack from the second top element of the stack

### mod
computes the rest of the division of the second top element of the stack by the top element of the stack.



## Brainf*ck

This project also exhibit the usage and operations of Brainf*ck programming.
